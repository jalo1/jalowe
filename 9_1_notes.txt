to import styles from another webpage, use

@import url("https://xxx")
CSS must match the id's of the semantic tags you are using!
or
<link href>
-> must be placed outside style tags!


only use tables for data, not design!
-> too hard to get info otherwise

webforms are external forms!
-> google fonts

<hr> represents a theme break

question:
look at code to see font change and using .x thing

            <link href="css/styles.css" rel
