inline style, it's in the html itself

table, tr, td, numbers , /, /, /

span is an inline element

div is not a semantic tag, doess not tell you what is in the block or where it goes


when specificing things, if you start with a /
"/img/x.x"
then it thinks you're starting from the root folder
vs
"img/x.x"

valid variable name for php can't have number at start
$seven7 = "ok";

can not have double nested quotes
1. use single quotes inside the double
2. escaping the double quotes with a \
\"exc\"

using numbers to label picture names is a trouble for visually impaired people

ideal situation, make an array of images to choose from

in php, use  .  instead of + to add strings,
-> useful for combining html tags onto things
