table, tr, td, numbers , /, /, /

span is an inline element

div is not a semantic tag, doess not tell you what is in the block or where it goes


when specificing things, if you start with a /

"img/x.x"

valid variable name for php can't have number at start
$seven7 = "ok";

2. escaping the double quotes with a \
\"exc\"
