        Pattern recognition is all about figuring out trends of data and what the trends represent. <br> Often times if there is a big enough
        data set then the trends that <br> come out of it can be deconstructed to represent an individual component of the whole. <br><br> 
        For example, if you have a large set of social data and find some patterns within it, you can start to make strong predictions <br>
        on what individuals who fit inside that pattern are doing! <br><br> Pattern recognition also tries to find patterns when no known
        trends are shown. The other half of pattern recognition is finding the patterns that nobody knows about! A computer can be trained
        to look for interesting and complex trends that a human would have trouble conceieving of!
