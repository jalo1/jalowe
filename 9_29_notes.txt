grap api url and insert it into the url spot on the api .php file
replace query with $keyword (it's xbox)

json,
start with a curly bracket a key and a value

xml

<query>
xbox
</query>

<categoryid>
123
</categoryId>

ternary operator

-------------------------------
SQL commands:
mysql-ctl install
mysql-ctl start
mysql -u root
-------------------------------

watch out for arrays called outside of functions, if they aren't
global then they can't be accessed. Won't be an error though

if you don't specify a method it will be the GET method

database stuff:
data integrity - user mistakes over time if given the option to put
the same thing in all the time
data redundency - same value in a column a lot

normalization: reduce redundency and increase integrity

in a large database, it's faster for primary keys to be small integers then strings

normal forms:
1 - every table gets a primary key, atomic values (aka firstName, lastName)

Conventions:
first field should be the primary key

relationships:
1 to 1, nothing special
one to many
1 to N, reciving end will get a foreign key of the other's primary key
many to many
N to M, a seperate relationtable containing each tables primary key
if thers multple N to M then you can sometimes jam many releationships into
the same relationship table

varchar: used when you don't know in advance how long the word is
char: known in advance



--------------------------------
only use left or right join when you need exlicitly all the information from one table or the other,
such as trying to find all departments that don't have a staff or something

use the command "lalalal :deviceName lals" to have safe placeholder
-> use this when getting form information to interact with sql tables
have an associatvie arry set the value of :deviceName
then insert that array into the $stmt -> execute($);

use $sql .= "asdf" to add on to the same strings

use single quotes in _GET commands ['x']

$x = array();
$x['y'] = "now it's an associate array";


with iFrame, in the <a href> url call, set a target variable = "x"
then set the <iFrame name= "x">


-----------------------------------
use print_r($arrayName) to display all values in array
use echo $recordName['record'] to display specific

associated arrays?

use fetchAll vs fetch for multiple vs single sql results!


-----------------------------------
input type text is always part of the URL

SHA1 needs 40 characters
the ? in the URL means that the form has been submitted and the server has refreshed
jqueay $ means get whatever element that is
aka # means get id, . gets class, etc
$("img").attr
$("#name").html

tags, attirbutes go in tags, values are the name of the tags

in javascript,
if you use for var in word
you'll get the index
if you use for var of word
you'll get the value


-----------------------------------

jquery is a javascript library (exectued on client)
.html is the jquery version, use .innerhtml with just javascript
in the ajax, make sure the url is https, or matches the protocol of your url

jquery dbug:
use console to see errors, use network tab to see the api results

data: { "state": $("#stateId").val()},
state here is the value in the url, #stateId").val() is what we're passing in via jquery

-----------------------------------

jquery files need to exist before bootstrap files do
personal css styles need to be after bootstrap files to overwrite them
make sure that inside a tags id value that it has '' around it, id = '1'
