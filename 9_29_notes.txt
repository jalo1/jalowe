grap api url and insert it into the url spot on the api .php file
replace query with $keyword (it's xbox)

json,
start with a curly bracket a key and a value

xml

<query>

ternary operator

-------------------------------
SQL commands:
mysql-ctl install
mysql-ctl start
mysql -u root
-------------------------------

watch out for arrays called outside of functions, if they aren't
global then they can't be accessed. Won't be an error though

if you don't specify a method it will be the GET method

database stuff:
data integrity - user mistakes over time if given the option to put
the same thing in all the time
data redundency - same value in a column a lot

normalization: reduce redundency and increase integrity

in a large database, it's faster for primary keys to be small integers then strings

normal forms:
1 - every table gets a primary key, atomic values (aka firstName, lastName)

Conventions:
first field should be the primary key

relationships:
1 to 1, nothing special
one to many
1 to N, reciving end will get a foreign key of the other's primary key
many to many
N to M, a seperate relationtable containing each tables primary key
if thers multple N to M then you can sometimes jam many releationships into
the same relationship table

varchar: used when you don't know in advance how long the word is
char: known in advance



--------------------------------
only use left or right join when you need exlicitly all the information from one table or the other,
such as trying to find all departments that don't have a staff or something

use the command "lalalal :deviceName lals" to have safe placeholder
-> use this when getting form information to interact with sql tables
have an associatvie arry set the value of :deviceName
then insert that array into the $stmt -> execute($);

use $sql .= "asdf" to add on to the same strings

use single quotes in _GET commands ['x']

$x = array();
$x['y'] = "now it's an associate array";


with iFrame, in the <a href> url call, set a target variable = "x"
then set the <iFrame name= "x">









-----------------------------------
input type text is always part of the URL
