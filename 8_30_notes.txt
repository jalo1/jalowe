semantic tags are used as descriptors for other people
to read your code
aka <nav>, <div>

<ul> is a non-semantic tag b/c it does not label a section
but rather provides a function, is also a block element

inline tags only effect whatever is between the <></>
aka <strong>

block tags consume an entire space
aka <h2>

x = some tag
X {
display: inline-block;
